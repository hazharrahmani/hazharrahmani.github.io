<h3>Description</h3>
Consider a system where we want to set up sensors to check whether the movement of an agent through an environment is based on an itinerary the agent has asserted before, or a situation where an engineer establishes a set of motion tracking cameras to check claims about a robot behavior, or an experiment where a scientist purchases data roaming services from multiple countries to test a hypothesis about migration patterns of eagles. All these three can be considered as applications of a problem this project focuses on. The aim of this problem is to choose an optimal selection from a set of sensors to ensure that an agent's execution fits a pre-disclosed itinerary.
