<h2>Accelerating combinatorial filter reduction through constraints</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
Reduction of combinatorial filters involves compressing state representations
that robots use. Such optimization arises in automating the construction of
minimalist robots. But exact combinatorial filter reduction is an NP-complete
problem and all current techniques are either inexact or formalized with
exponentially many constraints. 
This paper proposes a new formalization needing only a polynomial number of
constraints, and characterizes these constraints in three different forms:
nonlinear, linear, and conjunctive normal form. Empirical results show that 
constraints in conjunctive normal form capture the
problem most effectively, leading to a method that outperforms the others. 
Further examination indicates that a substantial proportion of constraints
remain inactive during iterative filter reduction. To leverage this
observation, we introduce just-in-time
generation of such constraints, which yields improvements in 
efficiency and has the potential to minimize large filters.
