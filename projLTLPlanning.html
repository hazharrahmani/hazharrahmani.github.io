<h3>Description</h3>
Temporal logics have become very useful tools for planning in robotics. This is because such logics, in one hand, are simple and intuitive for humans to use for specifying complex missions and tasks, and in the other hand, are precise   and   rigorous   for   robot   algorithms   to manipulate.  This project considers temporal logic planning with soft constraints and in the context of using robots to make chronicle of events that happen in stochastic environments.
